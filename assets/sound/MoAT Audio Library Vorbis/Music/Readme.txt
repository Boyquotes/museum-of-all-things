Including these songs in the game is optional, depending on whether or not you think it will fit the mood
to have music

My vision is that these songs would play in a randomized order, with 4 - 5 minutes of silence between each song.  

I thought it'd be fun to develop more songs, so in the coming days I'll probably have another 3-5 for you
to check out!
